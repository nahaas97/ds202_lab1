Nathan Haas

I tell people that Technical writing is essentially tailoring information towards a certain audience in a way that they can understand it.

The three most important strategies to organizing my work:
-Keep everything well organized (folders/locations for everything)
-Stick to the layout (dont put something somewhere else and say you'll move it later)
-One (slightly) interesting fact about me is that this past summer, I build my own computer from scratch.
